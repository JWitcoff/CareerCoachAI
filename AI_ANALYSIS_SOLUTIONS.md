# Real AI Analysis Solutions

## The Problem
Your OpenAI API key has exceeded its quota limit, preventing real AI analysis.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Upgrade Your OpenAI Plan (Recommended)
1. Visit https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
2. Upgrade to a higher tier plan
3. Set environment variable: `ENABLE_FULL_ANALYSIS=true`
4. Restart the application

### Option 2: Use Alternative AI Provider
I can integrate with other AI providers that might have available quota:
- Anthropic Claude API
- Google Gemini API
- Cohere API
- OpenRouter (access to multiple models)

### Option 3: Wait for Monthly Reset
Your OpenAI quota resets on your billing cycle date. Check your usage dashboard for the reset date.

### Option 4: Token-Efficient Real AI Analysis
Use chunked processing with gpt-4o-mini (90% cheaper) to maximize your remaining quota.
