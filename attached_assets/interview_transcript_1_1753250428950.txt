I reach out my hand. I'm going to use this one. I'm going to use this one. I'm going to use this one. I'm going to use this one. I'm going to use this one. I am right down the street from you. I'm right down the street from you. I've been looking into the one. I've been looking into the one. I have been trying to figure out I have been trying to figure out I don't even see him I don't even see him I'm one of the sickos who prefer to be in office I'm one of the sickos who prefer to be in office I like that sense of home is home I appreciate you making the time to meet with me This is really exciting This is really exciting Go through the people that I know Because I feel like that's always where you find the best connections Because I feel like that's always where you find the best connections I didn't talk a whole lot with Karth But he gave me a little bit of context I stalked you on LinkedIn So I have a little bit of background We have 30 minutes So I'll ask you a few questions I'll save at least the last 5 minutes If it's cool with you I can start with some of the things I wanted to ask I can start with some of the things I wanted to ask My time is your time Whenever you want to run this conversation, let's do it It looks like you're focused right now It looks like you're focused right now On Kotowari Labs It's a Japanese term It means the pursuit of perfection I see it now I don't have the tattoo on my body I don't have the tattoo on my body I guess I'd love to hear a little bit about how that came to be I guess I'd love to hear a little bit about how that came to be And what the day-to-day of that looks like right now I guess you don't have my resume It would be helpful to get a quick, concise overview So I started my career in sales I was one of the film jockey's I was one of the film jockey's I did that for 2 years before moving into a mid-market role at Dropbox I did that for 2 years before moving into a mid-market role at Dropbox My first part of my career was sales I really got into that to develop my ability to speak persuasively in a business context I really got into that to develop my ability to speak persuasively in a business context It was never really the long-term goal My first hypothesis was learn that skill set It will enhance whatever I do down the road and so far that's been true Left Dropbox, decided to go backpacking Thought it would be 3 weeks, ended up spending 9 months Happy to get more into that if you have questions or if we have more time Happy to get more into that if you have questions or if we have more time I realized that I love tech The thing I love most about tech is how brilliant, progressive and mission-oriented people are The thing I love most about tech is how brilliant, progressive and mission-oriented people are I had a section of it that was aligned with what I was interested in Which growing up and throughout my 20s was music So I decided to swing big, which is something I believe in to my core So I decided to swing big, which is something I believe in to my core Did the LA thing, moved here, slept on my brother's couch Hustled my way into a startup called Shift and sold 3 cars Which was weird because I've never sold cars, I don't know anything about cars I don't know why those people bought from me but I was 3 for 3 Nearly got fired by Shift because I had to drive across town at rush hour To have a meeting at WME I'm assuming you know what that agency is They've probably harassed you a lot at this point I would assume Either that or UTA Or both Most people don't know what it is So it's nice to have some context Ended up getting hired there, worked my way out of the mail room Worked my way up into supporting 2 different heads of department Put in my time, which I think is phrased the right way At WME as an assistant Not an agent person, again similar to sales Knew that that wasn't my end all be all But you really need a club card access to work in music And that was my foot in the door Was able to parlay that into the dream Which I'd written down on a piece of paper So I ended up working at Apple As the assistant for a guy named Zane Lowe Similar experience, was very weird to interview with someone Who I'd watched on my computer so many times He hired me, 6 months later was promoted to a product marketing role For Apple Music Radio Which is really, I felt like I was the glue guy If you know that term It was really there to help manage the cross-functional relationships I scaled from 30 programs to 100 So my job there was product marketing But more focused on the GTM operations side About a year and a half later was hired at Shazam Where I was responsible for the go-to-market launches For our suite of concert discovery features I left that, moved back to LA This is a much longer version than I intended to give you So apologies for that So last year was doing contract work Based on product marketing, go-to-market Went on site to a startup called Tixer for a few months And cleaned up their whole ideation to shipping funnel Which is exciting And then this year, actually based on the conversations I had with Parth Decided to swing big again and go all in on AI So what you see on LinkedIn or if you went to my site or anything like that This year I decided to treat myself like a startup Took a few lessons I had, gave myself a year of runway Which is really exciting, but also very scary And decided to basically have a three-pronged approach One, learn, just spend as much time as I can Trying to stay ahead of what's happening in AI You've been very helpful in that regard Two, building So actually building projects and getting my hands in the weeds Of the technical sides of things Whether that's building agents using OpenAI's SDK Or more recently spending a lot of time building projects with 11Labs And then three, actually sharing what I'm working on Which I still need to do a better job of On LinkedIn and then in conversation And hoping that that three-pronged approach creates a flywheel Of conversations that eventually lead to opportunities So I've been consulting I have a couple of clients that I'm working on right now And they're doing services on the AI front So probably exactly what you'd expect, the lowest hanging fruit What repetitive mundane tasks do you guys have that Create a certain level of pain or take a certain amount of hours And then I have them go through a type form flow that I built out Like rank their leads, rank their problems And then kind of tap back into my sales background Of being consultative of let's find out what you need first And then here's the services that I can do But the truth is my end goal Is not to be an AI consultant I'm lucky, I think, that there aren't that many here in LA I'm sure your network of AI consultants One of the things we're here to talk about is pretty talented But really, yeah This year was mainly focused on building my skill set And figuring out exactly where in AI I want to work And recently I decided that it's been I oscillate between Definitely have an entrepreneurial mindset But I oscillate between whether I want to be a founder Or go back into an early stage AI powered company Or work with a founder And I think for right now I'm more of a Scottie Pippen than a Jordan I think I like playing a supporting role and helping A leading man, a leading woman, whatever it may be I think that Attaching myself to a greater mission outside of myself Really helps motivate me and kick me into that third gear And so that's where I've been at That was a lot of information, that was way longer than I anticipated it being That's okay, that was really, really helpful Helps paint the background so no worries at all Really quickly before we move on Why did you leave Apple and why did you leave Shazam? Yeah, so Shazam was acquired by Apple Which most people don't know So that role moved me from LA to New York It was like during COVID I accepted that role on the contingency That I'd moved to New York At the time, my then long-term partner My dog, my wife and everything were in LA And so I ended up moving to New York I ended up living bi-coastal but not in the sexy, cool way In a very expensive, exhausting way And You know what? This is like a one-person shop I'll give you a more direct answer than I would normally give in a Fang interview The truth is, I got there The whole sell was that we would be in office And again, I like being in office I ended up just kind of sitting in the office by myself And it wasn't the experience I hoped it would be The team experience wasn't the experience I hoped it would be And I wasn't happy They knew I wasn't happy I ended up negotiating a buyout and deciding to take some time To move back to LA and kind of figure out what comes next And luckily The skill set that I've built has made it so that I've been able to pivot And succeed regardless But yeah, very hard decision to leave Apple That was my dream company for a really long time So leaving Apple and Shazam I still have great relationships over there But the long and short of it is it just wasn't the experience I hoped And the toll that I felt it was taking outweighed the benefit I felt I was getting Obviously the money was awesome But there's more to life than that So it sounds like the people aspect Being around other folks day to day is super important to you Yeah, and being around people with I would say a similar value system I think at anything Especially as you start to rise the ladder You realize that there are a lot of managers Who are brilliant individual contributors or ICs But when it comes to managing people It's a lot easier than it is actually empowering the people around them And that was very, very clear to me Specifically on the team that I was on And I don't know, I think there's something When you realize I just moved around the country Just so this person could show people that she's expanding her team Something about that just didn't really sit right But again, I learned a lot, I had a great experience overall I don't have anything negative or disparaging to say I don't know, I wanted some time to figure out what comes next Felt a really strong urge still do That I want to build something And I've been spending the last couple of years figuring out Again, doing well, but figuring out what it is exactly That I want to really throw myself into And how has been your experience I'm curious to learn more about the couple of clients That you've been working with on the AI side You've done the three-pronged thing, you're learning, you're building, you're sharing And then you started taking on clients How did that change the game for you And not only just your day-to-day schedule But what are you enjoying and maybe not enjoying About working directly with clients That's a great question I should say that I'm not actively marketing my services that much In part because I have this I think I have this fear Slash knowledge, I don't know exactly which term to index for That I don't want to do this full time And so part of me is almost afraid to lean into it too much And so I've been very selective in who I've worked for I've mainly gone through my existing network The first client that I had was Winston's Daycare My dog's daycare Because I've gone there, dropped them off so many times Again, the small businesses have a great low-hanging fruit The way that she was sending invoices and everything Just made no sense to me And so eventually I was like, hey, just so you know This is what I do, if you're willing to go through this 3-5 minute questionnaire It can actually probably help And so I got her to do it She went through and the problem is she's very scatterbrained And she has like 100 dogs a week Maybe pivot into daycare at some point But working with her was interesting Because it was very low risk Because it's someone I know and have a good relationship with But at the same time you want to deliver So it was interesting going from just being a mad scientist And tinkering in my apartment to actually having to do it on a deadline And build a solution that works for somebody else It's exciting, I enjoy it And so that's what I do for my career full-time Really the North Star for this year was to learn the skill set And then parlay it into something that's a bit more mission-driven That isn't just me But that's the first client I did So we helped her build out automations From email parsing, categorize inbound leads Drop it into an error table I know you've talked about doing some of this stuff as well N8n, I know you like Zapier They're all kind of the same to me, just N8n is the tool that I found And then on the flip side The main problem we solved She just had a bunch of disparate systems that weren't talking to each other And obviously one of the great things about AI is you can build systems And have them all communicate So you take someone who's really scatterbrained, really slammed Has all these different business inputs Now I get my invoices on a normal schedule I don't just get random charges that fall out of the sky And so that was great The other client that I'm working with a bit more slowly Is a podcast called 2B Magnetic You might have heard of it It's like a manifestation kind of woo-woo thing But it's worked really big and successful Particularly with the female demographic What they wanted to do is that they get testimonials everywhere They get testimonials on Instagram, TikTok, email, comments, blah, blah, blah And what they wanted to do was find similar problem set Just different category, I guess What they wanted to do was find a way to collate All of these testimonials So they can turn them into materials And outbound marketing stuff And so built crawlers that could actually collect those comments from Instagram It's a similar thing Collect comments from Instagram, testimonials, TikTok From the different systems that they're getting them in Drop them into an organized air table and then label them So that it's easy for them to find them And then when they want to create a testimonial, add it to the website It makes it easier for them to do that At the end of the day, why don't you want to do this full-time? At the end of the day, I don't want to do this full-time I realized that the As great as it is to choose my own schedule As great as it is to have this work-life balance The thing that I care most in life about is twofold Learning and growth And the cost of not being attached to a team or somebody else In terms of what I can learn And the skills I can build It doesn't outweigh to me the benefits of I'm very ambitious There's a lot of stuff that I want to get done And the thing that I've enjoyed always about work Particularly at places like Dropbox and Apple Is just being around people who are brilliant A combination of getting to learn from them And also activating the chip on my shoulder Of I belong in this room and I'm smart enough to be here And I don't know Maybe I'm a little bit nervous You're doing great I like being around Ambitious, smart, hard-working people That's what motivates me I have a level of motivation that I just have as a default Probably from family A grandchild of Jewish immigrants Who moved here with nothing And built themselves up The same old story I love working with other people I spent this last week in New York I did a hackathon with 11 labs And I got invited to an AI builder conference Absolutely nervous out of my mind to go into that room It's the first networking event I've gone to on my own In a long time with no brand attached to me When you say I work at Apple, everyone wants to talk to you You work at Google, everyone wants to talk to you It's a similar cachet to when you went to Stanford It's that thing where people immediately give you that level of credibility And not having that just gave me It was exciting, but it was nerve-wracking And then being in that room for a few hours And realizing that you actually deserve to be there Just the level of stimulation I felt from it It was a whole week of this It was really validating that the thing that I miss most Is being around other people and helping them build things that solve problems And not just doing it on my own And I do have a strong entrepreneurial drive I would like to be the founder of something eventually But I haven't yet found a problem that I feel like is big enough That is a big enough problem that has scale That I also feel well-suited to solve I spend a lot of time with the hammer and nail analogy I spend a lot of time playing with the hammer I love the hammer, I love coming up with solutions I'm on the lookout for nails, but I haven't yet found one So right now I've been I'm talking to 11 Labs about a QA role To help build out Basically a role where I play with their products until they break And I come up with solutions So that would be really exciting and awesome But I'm just now starting to put myself out there again And actually reach out for specific AI roles While you didn't ask this, I'm going to answer it anyway The reason I reached out for this role specifically Is that I don't think you ever I've never seen a great company in tech or otherwise Where the founder isn't extremely passionate and mission-led And that the people beneath that founder Don't believe to the same degree So regardless of which way this interview process goes You've been a huge inspiration to me I don't know if it's from the earliest days that I followed you But I think it was from pretty early Because I remember talking to Parth about your trajectory last year And talking about it again this year And being like, Jesus Christ, I don't know But I find you personally incredibly inspiring I think just from the Again, it's really weird to get to know someone virtually Without ever talking to them But based on what you put out there, I think you have a really beautiful blend Of intellect and vulnerability And I think that's probably a huge part of your success Because it appeals to people who want to put themselves out there a little bit more But maybe are a little bit more shy, I'm certainly personally in that category And so when I saw you post the thing And I know you said maybe a recent grad Which I'm not that recent of a grad I reached out to Parth and I was like, I really believe in Kat I'm really excited by the business she's growing And candidly I would do whatever I could to help her build But then this role specifically, I think I could do really well Because two reasons, one, I've done product marketing at the FANG level And have that level of training And two, for the specific part of your business that you're trying to grow I understand both sides, I understand the AI consulting side of it As one myself, regardless of whether I've been marketing or not And two, I understand the stakeholder side of it And so I already have a bunch of ideas about how we could How you could better qualify leads that come in Collate the feedback from those And build systems and make it a bit easier to A bit more efficient to connect the right leads with the right people Okay, not knowing who your leads are or who the people are in your network I think the same process is the same Is you ask really good questions, you figure out what it is that people need You get to the root of those pain points, then you find solutions Yeah No, thank you for that, I really do appreciate it It means a lot And yeah, I definitely see your experience on both sides of that For sure, in your prior history I guess candidly, and I'll just speak very bluntly Because I want to get your honest take too I don't actually think I have many doubts about whether or not You'd be able to do the role well, my question is more of like Would you enjoy the role? Because just for context The size of the team right now is me and my assistant And the goal is to grow this year, for sure We have an office here in West Hollywood And like I mentioned There's probably, I would say 1, 2, maybe 3 more full-time hires By the end of this year, but it's July So that's over the course of the next 6 months And that's why I tend to ask a lot of questions In the introductory interviews About what motivates you, what gets you excited What puts you in a flow state, what are you looking for Because at the end of the day, it's easy to find someone who's qualified I can see on LinkedIn, this person is probably qualified They probably have the skills, but the skills are completely orthogonal To actual motivations And so when I hear you say stuff like, I want to be surrounded by Witspark people, totally get it, I'm the exact same way Believe me, I'm craving the same thing And I'm lucky enough to be in this position where I'm like, cool, I'm going to go find one And hey, them come in and help me Let's just have an honest conversation about that Do you have any concerns about team size And the fact that we're really small No, I actually I don't think I've ever used the word glaze in an interview before But in the spirit of honesty When I was preparing for our conversation I actually built out An interview coach using 11labs I was trained on what you said And what you can do And so I've just been having conversations with that basically all day yesterday Like a psychopath, just talking to my computer But one of the things I had to ask was I have a very high level of respect for the person interviewing me tomorrow Can you help me figure out a way to convey that without glazing Because I think Obviously most people appreciate flattery It's a pretty low touch way To build favor and build goodwill I guess is a better way to put it But truthfully, I'm still trying to not glaze I've watched your trajectory from early days Again, I don't know specifically when And I really admire One, I think you're whip smart Two, I really admire your drive and the way you put yourself out there It's interesting, I think you did a follow up video On the fact that people felt this way And I was one of people But the video you did about going to Cannes rewired my neural network Of like, I don't even know how to put it But I've thought about it so many times since Because it's Yeah, I think you're on the other How do you put it? On the other end of the hill I don't want to get too fancy with it In general, I really believe you as a product Not to productize it too much or be too nerdy But I believe in you, your business And really think whatever you would go into I would want to be a part of if there were an opportunity And I even said this to Parth I'm not a great self-negotiator But I was like, I know if it's a recent grad role That as a byproduct of being around that business Would outweigh short-term financial benefits And I'm very much like a long-term thinker Most of my thinking is like, which is actually how I ended up meeting Parth It's very like Reid Hoffman-esque I've been listening to Masters of Scale Since like 2015 When I worked at Dropbox in the Bay Area I would ride my little Vespa to work listening to Masters of Scale And then I started following Parth A couple of years Parth and I have a mutual friend in common Who's like the head of Gen AI for Canva Brilliant guy And Parth was just posting all this weird shit about agents and stuff Like years ago And I started being intrigued like, what is this stuff? And then I'm also very persistent I'm losing the trail of my thought a little bit Yeah, you're good You're talking about meeting Parth And I think how it relates to me Yeah, I don't know I think I got off track a little bit To answer your question more concisely and more directly It doesn't need to be 50 smart people I think being around 1, 2, 3 is enough Winston is not a good strategist He doesn't really have very good input I'm a big believer in you as a product And like I said earlier I'm stubborn in that I don't want to work for Or with anybody or anything that I'm not passionate about It's one of the reasons why I haven't gone back into the traditional workforce My North Star for a long time was music I worked in music, I'm happy to tell you more about it It just wasn't the experience that I hoped it would be And then I already touched on why I left Apple And so the last two years has really been What is the North Star? Because when I care, I really care I'll work my ass off and I'll do it well But when I don't care, it's a different story Long story short, I really need to wrap up I'm not rambling Let me hop in there I can go five minutes over It sounds like you're saying The North Star has been about this process Of getting as much exposure as possible And learning and really throwing yourself into this AI world It's been about a year since you've started doing that? It's probably more like six or seven months Call it seven months You've been doing that for seven months Have you identified out of that process This is the piece of it that I know I want to go in on? Or would you categorize yourself still As you're in a data collection phase You're in a discovery phase And this is an ever-changing, fast-moving place Even if you did decide one thing one day It might shift the next day Would you say you've identified the thing Or you're still in exploration phase? No right answer here A little column A, a little column B I think what attracts me in general From a work perspective Is working with a tool or a product Or I would want to work for open AI for instance For someone like me who's interested As a relentlessly curious individual It's empowered me to go an inch deep, a mile wide Or a mile deep on any subject that I want It's put me in a position where I can self-educate If it puts me in a position where I can self-educate It means I grew up on the north side of Chicago I had a great public education People on the south side of Chicago, not the same story But tools like this help level the playing field And I think that's a beautiful thing So that's one example, but 11 Labs for instance If I can build an interview coach, somebody else can And applying that to you and your business Again, it's your mission head Which I think your positioning is really strong I'm not going to repeat it But you teach me a lot of things Which means you're making a really positive impact on others So I guess the through line is within AI It has to be something that I find particularly interesting But from a mission perspective, not Palantir Something that is a net positive on the consumer population And while obviously you, Open AI, 11 Labs Very different products, very different offerings I would say that that's the through line Okay, cool Probably time for one question Is there anything I can answer for you And thank you for being willing to go a couple of minutes over Yeah, of course If we only have a minute or two Based on this conversation, do you have any lingering doubts or concerns About an ability to work? I have much deeper questions for you, but being mindful of time Ask me a deeper question Because I have so many more conversations to have at this point You're the second person I've spoken to And I think this conversation sounds super interesting But I can't even give you a good answer right now A deeper question, do you feel any level of anxiety or fear By putting yourself out there on a consistent basis? I know that you've said that the starting state was You weren't going to be going to France Because 99.9% of people don't have that mental framework So is that something that you had to build Or do you still feel a sense of fear when you post Or is that confidence just sort of innate and built in at this point? I guess it could be categorized as confidence To me it doesn't even feel so much like that though Because I think I just don't take it that seriously Here's the thing When I was in college I had a YouTube channel And I walked away from it I just totally walked away and shut it down And within a couple of months everyone forgot about it And no one was talking about it and I wasn't being asked about it And nobody cared I think that experience made me realize how temporary everything is And so I don't take myself too seriously Because I know if I didn't post a video The only person who would ever even notice is me Maybe a thousand people would notice for the first week And then after two weeks ten people would notice And then after three weeks it would be zero That's just the reality of how temporary things are as they live on the internet And so I guess I put myself out there Because if it works, great Then I get the actual experience that I wanted And if not, then like I said in the video I wasn't going to go to France anyways So I might as well just put myself out there I would still say that's a unique mindset But that's an interesting way to think about things I think it's interesting Because it really ultimately is very low stakes Whether you post something that works or doesn't work I also get a lot of content in my For You page That's like creator hype Like just post the video Nobody cares if it flops, just post it And so I feel like as I'm getting inundated with that message every day It's probably burying itself into my subconscious And I do have that voice that's like You would be surprised how much of the time before I post a video Jiminy Cricket on my shoulder is going, nah fuck it That's really my attitude towards posting those videos I should be much more data driven and analytical Because I know there are other creators who are like But a lot of it has to come down to a creative instinct At the same time I think that makes a lot of sense I don't know if you're a Tyler the Creator guy I don't love his music but I love his mentality And he's been very consistent in saying just share You don't know who's going to see it You don't know who's going to like it and who's not But the only way to guarantee that no one sees it is to keep it in your mind And that's something I've been working to adopt significantly more over the past year I love it, I love it Well I'm glad that you reached out about this I would count that as a win in that bucket Excited to keep chatting for sure Let's stay in touch, I'll follow up with next steps soon Or Maggie will and I have to run off to the next thing But it was really great meeting you Justin Thanks a lot, I really appreciate your time Bye
