JOB DESCRIPTION:
${jobDescription}

${additionalContext ? `ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:\n${additionalContext}\n` : ''}

Analyze the resume against the job description and provide your response in JSON format with the following structure:

  "gaps": ["specific gap 1", "specific gap 2", ...],

      "idealAnswerTraits": ["trait 1", "trait 2", "trait 3"]

Guidelines:
- Generate 3-5 strengths that specifically align with the job requirements
- Identify 3-5 gaps or areas for improvement  
- Provide 2-3 formatting suggestions with before/after examples
- Generate 5-8 role-specific interview questions derived from the job description
- For each interview question, provide 3-4 ideal answer traits
- Be direct and honest - the goal is to help the user get hired`
